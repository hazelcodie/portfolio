        <div class="photo" data-description="Hi! I'm Hazel Delda, a senior Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) student at Biliran Province State University. Passionate about both technology and design, I have a growing interest in UI/UX and front-end development, where I blend creativity with functionality to enhance user experiences.<br> 

<br>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained experience in coding especially web development. While I gravitate toward front-end design, I'm also expanding my knowledge of different programming languages and exploring the back-end side of development.<br> Currently, I’m working on a WordPress project, while also learning ReactJS. 

Beyond academics, I enjoy reading books and running . Excited about the future, I’m continuously improving my skills and preparing for opportunities in the tech industry.">
